# src/typings

Use this folder to store _ambient_ types only.

These include:

- Types for 3rd-party deps where no community type definitions exist
- Type extensions for 3rd-party deps _where absolutely needed_
- Import declarations where types cannot be derived (e.g. svg / png assets)
- Generic utility types

Typings for app / domain specific entities should go into the relevant domain's
`types`
